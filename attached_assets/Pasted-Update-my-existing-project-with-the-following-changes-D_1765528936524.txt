Update my existing project with the following changes.
Do NOT change my project’s major functionality, working flow, structure, or overall design.
Only add, fix, or enhance features exactly as described below.

1) Add “Chalan Revise” Button Inside Chalan Entry

Add one “Revise Chalan” button inside the existing Chalan Entry screen.

Do NOT create a separate module/screen—revise should open a new full screen, not a popup.

In the new “Revise Chalan” screen:

Show all details of the selected chalan.

Include all filters (date range, status, customer, booking reference, etc.) same as current chalan revise module.

UI must be clean, attractive, and follow existing project colors.

Keep all core logic same—just embed revise functionality inside the chalan entry.

2) Add Full History Button in Booking, Chalan & Leave Sections

Add a small “History” button in:

Booking section

Chalan section (cancelled, delivered, confirmed, pending, etc.)

Leave entry section

When clicked:

Open a full-screen history viewer (not popup).

Show complete history of:

Created

Updated

Cancelled

Delivered

Status changed

Revised

History must include:

Date & Time

User who performed the action

Old values → New values (if applicable)

Add filters (date range, user, type of activity).

Never delete any history (permanent log).

Display in reverse chronological order.

3) Status Fields Should Be Clickable & Toggle Status

Wherever the project has status fields, e.g.:

Active / Inactive

Delivered / Pending

Confirmed / Cancelled

Available / Not available

etc.

Add these functionalities:

Status labels should be clickable.

On click → show small dropdown or toggle to switch status.

Apply proper permission checks (only authorized users can change status).

Status update should:

Immediately update in database

Update UI instantly

Add an entry in history (from point #2)

⚠️ Important Requirements
Keep all code structure, logic, UI layout, styling standards exactly same as current project.

Only fix or add features without breaking existing modules.

No major rewrite.

Just improve, extend, and fix functionalities as described.

🎯 Final Output Expected

"Chalan Revise" fully functional inside chalan entry

Full history tracking system (create/update/cancel/status/logs)

Status fields fully clickable with proper toggling

Clean UI and smooth functionality

All features working without breaking current logic
